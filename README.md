PyDip -- Diplomacy Adjudication Engine

------

TL;DR: This is a library intended to resolve orders issued in the game
Diplomacy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy\_(game)).

The engine is written to follow recommended rules from the Diplomacy
Adjudicator Test Cases (DATC) site
(http://web.inter.nl.net/users/L.B.Kruijswijk/), with the exception that
this engine does not permit ambiguous orders, and Civil Disobedience
procedures are currently simplified.
